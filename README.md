At the time the keylogger was made i use the 3.10.6 Version of Python and the 3.10 on Microsoft Store But that can be changed if its not work on newer verison use the version the developer uses i think that will fix it

The keylogger is a non virus one so it will not be detected by antivirus

But dont use it to illegal things just use it for fun prank you friends or something if it will be used to illegal things i dont want to apologise for it and i am not a part of it and will not be held liable for its use just so you know
